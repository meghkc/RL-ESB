# RL-ESB
Reinforcement Learning Application for Simultaneous Fleet Optimization and Charging Scheduling for Multi-line Bus Transit System in Dynamic Environment
# Motivation:
Many studies on the Electric Bus Charging and Scheduling Problem operate under deterministic and constant parameter assumptions, typically formulating the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. While such deterministic models simplify formulation and solution processes, they fail to account for real-world uncertainties. These include random variations in travel time and energy consumption, as well as fluctuations in electricity prices within the smart grid. Addressing these uncertainties is crucial for developing robust and efficient EB scheduling strategies.
